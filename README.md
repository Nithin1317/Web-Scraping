# Web-Scraping
In this project we are going to scrape data from different social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit.

# Twitter Scraping
- Twitter has recently made some changes which affected every third party Twitter client.(ex- snscrape)
- So I am using ntscraper(Unofficial Nitter scraper)
- This is a simple library to scrape Nitter instances for tweets. It can:
  - search and scrape tweets with a certain term
  - search and scrape tweets with a certain hashtag
  - scrape tweets from a user profile get profile information of a user, such as display name, username, number of tweets, profile picture
